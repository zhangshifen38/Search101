	""Power generation, freight volume and bank loans have all declined since April. Without a certain level of GDP growth, stable employment cannot be realized. One good thing is that we refrained from excessive money supply and mass stimulus in the past few years, and we still have policy tools in reserve,"" Li said.,
	The meeting decided to implement 33 measures in six aspects, which mainly include fiscal and related policies, to keep the operation of market entities and employment stable.

	The policy of deferred premium payments of old-age, unemployment and workplace safety insurance programs by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, self-employed households and companies in the catering, retail, tourism, civil aviation, and highway, waterway and railway transportation sectors will be prolonged until the end of this year, and extended to other industries facing serious difficulties. As a result, the deferred payments this year will reach 320 billion yuan.,
	,
	The subsidy for retaining employees under unemployment insurance will be extended to all hard-hit enterprises participating in the plan. The re-guarantee business of the national financing guarantee fund will be increased by more than 1 trillion yuan this year.,
	Energy security will be ensured. The policy for approving the increased production capacity of coal mines will be recalibrated, and procedures for designating coal mines especially important for energy supply will be accelerated. A number of new hydropower and coal-fired power projects will start this year.,
	The meeting decided to implement a string of financial policies. The scale of the support facility for inclusive loans to micro and small businesses will be doubled this year. Banks will be supported in deferring, within this year, principal and interest repayments on loans made to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed households, as well as truck loans, home loans and consumer loans borne by individuals facing temporary difficulties.,
	""For China, development is the basis and key for resolving all problems. We must efficiently coordinate COVID response with economic and social development and better use the experience we gained in the past two years,"" Li said,
	""Policy support must be beefed up, and policy measures should be swiftly rolled out wherever needed, to keep major economic indicators within an appropriate range and ensure stable overall economic performance."",
	The meeting adopted measures to stabilize industrial and supply chains. The policies to enable early reopening of enterprises and their full-capacity production will be fine-tuned.,
	,
	The meeting stressed the imperative need to ensure people's basic livelihoods. Support must be provided for people eligible for unemployment benefits and subsistence allowances and people facing difficulties. The mechanism of raising social benefits to keep pace with price increase will be promptly activated should the situation require.,
	Restrictions on the passage of trucks from low-COVID-risk areas will be lifted and all undue limits and arbitrary charges will be scrapped. Domestic and international passenger flights will be increased in a well-paced manner.,
	Consumer spending and effective investment will be boosted, and car purchase restrictions will be relaxed. There will be a phased reduction of purchase tax totaling 60 billion yuan on some passenger vehicles. City-specific policies will be adopted to meet people's basic housing needs and their wish to improve housing conditions.,

	BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt measures for sound agricultural production in the spring to ensure a bumper harvest and stable supply of major agricultural products, according to a decision made at the State Council's Executive Meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.,
	The meeting pointed out that job security and price stability are both key underpinnings for keeping major economic indicators within an appropriate range.,
	The stable production and supply of grains and other important agricultural products serve as an anchor for overall economic and social stability, especially for keeping consumer prices stable and ensuring people's essential needs. This is particularly important given the growing uncertainties in the international food market and high inflation in some countries.,
	""We must pay great attention to agricultural production now, and keep up with the farming schedule. China enjoys sufficient provision and reserve of grains, and spring sowing this year is steadily advancing. Food security can be guaranteed."" Li said.,
	""All localities must strictly fulfill their responsibilities for food security. The coordinated progress of COVID-19 response and spring agricultural production will be an important part of performance assessment,"" he said.,
	According to the premier, special task forces will be set up to coordinate the efforts for agricultural production in the spring, sufficient provision and stable prices of agricultural supplies, and marketing of agricultural products.,
	The full-year targets of grain acreage and output will be broken down, and localities are urged to carry out spring sowing in full and during the optimum time and leave no farmland uncultivated. Those who fail to complete assigned tasks will be held accountable.,
	The primary role of new types of agribusiness will be brought into play, to provide such services as third-party cultivation and help small household farmers and those affected by COVID-19 farm their land.,
	Concrete efforts must be made to ensure sound spring plowing and other agricultural activities. Well-calibrated steps will be taken to organize and guide the activities. To keep up with the farming schedule, work will be done to help migrant farmers return home for farming, facilitate the availability of agricultural supplies in rural areas, ensure the passage of agricultural machinery and make the services of agricultural technicians more accessible to farmers.,
	The policy of ""green lane"" service for the transportation of fresh farm produce will be implemented to facilitate smooth circulation of vegetables and other agricultural products.,
	Policies to support and benefit farmers will be effectively implemented. Funds for assisting grain production will be delivered to farmers as quickly as possible.,
	Measures will be explored to increase agricultural supplies subsidies, and grains procurement as necessary will be conducted in a timely manner to keep grain-growers motivated.,
	The meeting also identified policy steps to ensure and increase energy supply, and continue to optimize the energy mix, to expand effective investment and job creation, and enhance the capacity of energy in driving economic and social development.,
	The meeting pointed out that energy is the fundamental underpinning of economic and social development. It is essential to address the new challenges of the external environment based on China's own national conditions, and strengthen energy supply with well-defined priorities. It is important to plan ahead and stay prepared, take forward energy projects with ripe conditions that meet development needs.,
	""Energy is a matter of critical importance. We must plan ahead and stay prepared, and be self-reliant in ensuring energy security,"" Li said.,
	The meeting decided that the role of coal as the primary energy source should be harnessed. Concerted efforts must be made to fine-tune the review and approval policies regarding the production, project construction and other activities of coal enterprises. Sub-national governments must earnestly fulfill their responsibilities for stable production and provision, and advanced production capacity should be fully unlocked.,
	The country will strive to increase coal production capacity by 300 million tonnes this year by approving higher production capacity, expanding output and putting new projects into operation.,
	Clean and efficient use of coal will be promoted, and construction of reserve facilities intensified. Market-oriented and law-based approaches will be applied to guide coal prices toward running within an appropriate range.,
	Efforts will be made to renovate coal-fired power plants to conserve resources, reduce carbon emissions, make operations more flexible and upgrade heating facilities, with the aim of raising energy efficiency and transforming more than 220 million kilowatts of coal-fired power capacity this year.,
	Such renovation should be conducted during routine repair and maintenance of power generation units, to avoid disrupting stable power supply. Financial policies in support of the renovation of coal-fired power units will be earnestly implemented.,
	Nuclear power will be developed in a well-paced manner on the premise of ensuring absolute security and exercising strict oversight. With years of preparations and comprehensive assessment and review, approval is granted for the projects of new nuclear power units identified in the national plan in Sanmen of Zhejiang Province, Haiyang of Shandong Province and Lufeng of Guangdong Province.,
	""We must fully unleash the production capacity of quality coal. Government departments across the country should provide full support,"" Li said. ""We must ensure the absolute security of nuclear power. Regulations in this regard should be effectively enforced.""_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
